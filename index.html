      I spend a lot of time learning and improving myself in various field of IT and programming languages, The current environment in which I work is HTML, CSS, JavaScript as the primary programming language, Bootstrap, SaaS, MySql. I am also currently working on and learning Node.js in addition to my previosu knowledge and to complete one unit as an IT professional.

      </p>
    
      
<br>
      <p>In college, I worked with Java and C# and have a basic knowledge of those programming languages. I also know AutoCad well, which I worked on while creating 2D and 3D objects. I am excellent in the MsOffice package, and for my own design needs I also learned Photoshop, which I do very well. I also learned the basics of the Figma program out of pure interest in website design. I worked with WordPress as well as with Wix, while studying I made my own eCommerce website for the needs of the school. I also have knowledge of DNS and cPanel.</p>
  
<br>
      <p>I am very motivated and eager to work in a team, although I do not have adequate work experience, I belive that I can justify the expectations that are reqyured of me in a certain position. I am willing to prove myself as an excellent teammate in junior positions, I am alslo open to internships in juniot frontentds positions.
        <img src="image/PortfolioSlika2.jpg" alt="PortfolioSlika2" class="align-right slide-in"> In addition to being motivated and ready to prove myself and work with the team, I also consider myself a perfectionist when it comes to business. I am ambitious in my work, I find motivation in various real life situations. I am open to communitaion in all fields, I am very organized as far as my responsibilities are concerned, in addition I am direct in communicating with superiors.
        I am aware that I have no experience in my work, more precisely that I was not employed in certain IT positions, but I am ready to justify every minute of the time you give me to show my self in the best light and leave the best positive impression on you.
      </p>


<br>
      <p>My wish is to apply my acquired knowledge and skills acquired during my studies and through independent learning and improvement in a new random environment, which would enable my persnoal progress and prosperity as well as my contribution to the team.
